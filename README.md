# Problem statement 
    • We wanted to create an ios app and mobile friendly web app that would make it simple for citizen reporting on lost and found fishing gear
    • As well as a public API that would allow researchers and interested parties to access crowdsourced data
# Approach 
    • Split our team into 
        ○ Ios team(jessica)
        ○ Rails team that split into
            § Web app/UI team(austin)
            § API/visualization/deployment(hailey)
# How it works 
    • Lost/found gear can be reported via either ios or web
    • Any new entries are immediately accessable via the API
    • Visualization charts also dynamically updated
    • Easy to add other visualization types like scatterplots, bar graphs, etc
    • Can also easily add different aspects of the data to analyze
# What still has to be done
    • API
        ○ Would like to make the API streaming so that there's no need for researchers to poll it
    • Map
        ○ Would like to add clusters to mapping so that as data scales the map isnt overwhelmed with data points
        ○ Would like to add hover details over map markers that describes the gear
        
# Statement of impact
    • We hope this will help the ghost gear problem because
        ○ It allows anonymous reporting of lost gear
        ○ The easy UI will hopefully allow:
            § Expansion of dataset 
                □ Anonymous reporting removes disincentive to hide that gear has been lost
                □ Multiple methods of reporting allow users with older technologies to still participate in reporting
            § Real-time data
                □ API allows researchers to see where lost and found gear is reported in realtime
                    ® This allows dataset to stay relevant
                    ® Allows retrieval crews to have most up to date location and description of ghost gear
